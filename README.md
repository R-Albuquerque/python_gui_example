# python_gui_example

Basic example of a GUI in Python, made with the PySimpleGUI package.

A nice way to show how simple yet effective GUI's can be built for Python programs using little code.
This is a simple program that allows the user to select a folder and visualize the images within that folder.

Must have the PySimpleGUI package installed.

Based on some similar code from RealPython.com, but modified for educational purposes.
